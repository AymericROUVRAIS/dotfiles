# Config file

These are my config files for Arch Linux.

## Programms in the config

A couple of programms should be installed for this to work. This can
be done by hand or with the `install.sh` script.

- Bspwm and polybar
-  Alacritty with zsh
- Neovim and a couple of dependecies for the packages:
  - latex packages
- Brightnessctl and pulsemixer

For latex (also needed for Neovim config):

- texlive-binextra
- pdflatex
- texlive-langfrench

- openfortivpn
- onlyoffice
- drawio
- atril
- autocpufreq
